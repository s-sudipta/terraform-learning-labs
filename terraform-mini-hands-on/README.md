# 🚀 Terraform Learning Labs

This repository contains multiple small, focused Terraform labs created as part of my Infrastructure as Code (IaC) learning journey.

Each lab is designed to explore and practice specific Terraform concepts in a simple and hands-on way.

These implementations are built for learning purposes and experimentation — not as production-ready infrastructure.
